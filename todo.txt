Add user defined probabilities for production rules (abop page 66)

Have a substitution step at the end

JSON import/export

Redo GUI for rules

When originating from a selected face, turtles should start aligned to the normal

optional growth animation:
  - Enable animation via checkbox in GUI
  - Use object.hide = True / False to "fake" animate growth.
