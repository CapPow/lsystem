Bug: I get different objects when I change number of instances but the same seed.

Add user defined probabilities for production rules (abop page 66)

Have a substitution step at the end

JSON import/export

Redo GUI for rules

When originating from a selected face, turtles should start aligned to the normal of the selected face

optional growth animation:
  - Enable animation via checkbox in GUI
  - Use object.hide = True / False to "fake" animate growth.
    See http://blenderscripting.blogspot.com/2011/07/scripted-keyframing-of-hide-hide-render.html

Support for timed D0L-systems? (abop chapter 6)

Tropism?

vector functions in turtle/lsystem

abscission ( '%' operator in abop)
