Bug: Weird behaviour with duplicate objects when min_iterations = 0

Bug: I get different objects when I change number of instances but the same seed.
     I'm guessing "bpy_extras.mesh_utils.triangle_random_points(1, [face])" randomizes the seed?

Add user defined probabilities for production rules (abop page 66)
  - Include variable probabilities

optional growth animation:
  - Enable animation via checkbox in GUI
  - Use object.hide = True / False to "fake" animate growth.
    See http://blenderscripting.blogspot.com/2011/07/scripted-keyframing-of-hide-hide-render.html

Support for timed D0L-systems? (abop chapter 6)

Tropism?

vector functions in turtle/lsystem

abscission ( '%' operator in abop p. 73)

Call lsystem from lsystem (recursive lsystems)

Document "replacements" in readme or replace it with recursive lsystems

Add an example for ~ operator

Define custom operations (ie execute python code when turtle encounters "A(x,y,z)")

Better custom operation/interpretation example
