Bug: I get different objects when I change number of instances but the same seed.

Create new meshes at cursor instead of at origin

Have a substitution step at the end

JSON import/export

Redo GUI for rules

optional growth animation:
  - Enable animation via checkbox in GUI
  - Use object.hide = True / False to "fake" animate growth.
